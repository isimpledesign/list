There's nothing too out of the ordinary here. Since we'll be using the same header, sidebar and footer across every page of the site, it makes sense to only code these once, and reference them when needed. We do this right at the top and at the bottom of this page. Loading a view file is exactly the same as how we did inside the controller.
